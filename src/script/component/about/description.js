            currently living in welcoming Vancouver. Most of my day I work on
            commercial and personal projects that usually end up being
            full-stack front-end.</p>
            <p>During the day offs I usually read, dance, and furiously trying
            to teach myself White Hat Hacking and Network Security.</p>
            <p>Need a mobile-optimized landing page, web-application, or just a
            simple website? Feel free to contact me anytime!
